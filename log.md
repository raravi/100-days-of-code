# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Trying out firebase with a React app. Created a React app. Then created a firebase DB. And connected the two for now. Using the freeCodeCamp React exercise for Todoist clone.

**Thoughts** The going is slow. But there are many concepts to grasp. React hooks, firebase, Sass mixins.

**Link(s) to work** No link yet, I have to create a repo and safeguard the API keys before that!

### Day 2: June 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Todoist clone: firebase API key has been obfuscated, and the repo set up for project. Sudoku: Working on Sudoku game in React. Setting up the static version of the site.

**Thoughts** Good progress today. Satisfied.

### Day 4: June 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Sudoku: Moved the code into different components. Added Timer functionality using [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and useEffect hook. Used the map() function to keep the code DRY.

**Thoughts** moment.js took most of my time today.
