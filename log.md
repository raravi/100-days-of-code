# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Trying out firebase with a React app. Created a React app. Then created a firebase DB. And connected the two for now. Using the freeCodeCamp React exercise for Todoist clone.

**Thoughts** The going is slow. But there are many concepts to grasp. React hooks, firebase, Sass mixins.

**Link(s) to work** No link yet, I have to create a repo and safeguard the API keys before that!
